# Upgrade from ~1.1 to 1.2.0

## Accord\MandrillSwiftmailer Dependency

Starting from 1.2.0, the Mandrill transport class is provided via the [Accord/MandrillSwiftMailer](https://github.com/AccordGroup/MandrillSwiftMailer) repository.

If you're using Accord\MandrillSwiftMailerBundle to gain access to the transport class in a non-Symfony project, we strongly recommend that you use this new library.
